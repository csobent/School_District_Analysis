# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
As we worked through this module, we managed to gather plenty of data to help with this analysis. We performed calculations including taking the average scores for each school in math, reading, and then overall, as well as the percentages for the same categories. We also calculated the total budget per each school, as well as the amount spent per each student. In working through the data, we are able to go through different schools and zoom in on their different statistics, if needed. In this specific analysis, we are focusing on Thomas High School and replacing the ninth grade's math and reading scores with NaNs in order to evaluate the data properly without any dishonesty. We are exploring how making these changes will affect the overall analysis.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

- ### How is the district summary affected?

- ### How is the school summary affected?

- ### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

- ### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

- ### Math and reading scores by grade

- ### Scores by school spending

- ### Scores by school size

- ### Scores by school type

## Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
